# haiku-lunch
tasty nuggets of poetry about things I've eaten


#### tracking how I built this

github create new repo
select 'readme', type of .gitignore and MIT licence?
copy the SSH key
git clone locally

##### DB

create db locally (psql doesn't like - in database names)
create schema and seed files
INSERT INTO haiku (first_line, second_line, third_line, subject) VALUES ();

##### Flask server

create a server.py
create a virtual environment
create a requirement.txt file
checked no of records in table, generated random number and pulled random record from table

##### create a react front end

never remember where to create!
