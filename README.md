# haiku-lunch
tasty nuggets of poetry about things I've eaten

## 2 hour website challenge
Recently I'm VERY busy. Working a full time job and a part time job on a Software Engineer course and in my spare time trying to pivot into full time wok as a Junior Developer. I feel like I barely have time for a kata or two on Codewars.
Today 31.10.2022 I set a 2 hour website challenge for myself. The aim was to create a basic database, flask server and react front end which would randomly display a silly haiku I'd written about a meal I'd eaten.

### PROGRESS! 30/11/2022


#### tracking how I built this

github create new repo
select 'readme', type of .gitignore and MIT licence?
copy the SSH key
git clone locally

##### DB

create db locally (psql doesn't like - in database names)
create schema and seed files
INSERT INTO haiku (first_line, second_line, third_line, subject) VALUES ();

##### Flask server

create a server.py
create a virtual environment
create a requirement.txt file
checked no of records in table, generated random number and pulled random record from table

##### create a react front end
